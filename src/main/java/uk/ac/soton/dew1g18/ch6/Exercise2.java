    /**
     * Really no need to create a class for this as its just an exercise telling me to go read about supported file types and
     * stuff but I might as well make notes on it while we're here
     *
     *
     * For me, for future reference if you want a list of all of them the site is here :
     * https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-vfs/filesystems.html
     *
     * The rundown is you can get data from many different places using the different supported file systems which
     * include things from Jars to Zips and connecting through ftps.
